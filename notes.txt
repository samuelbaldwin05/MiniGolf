FUTURE FIXES (minor things that can be changed letter)

Ugly menu screen, and is different for when a game ends than when the app is first loaded

On build reset, everything resets except ball (all or nothing)

Expandable score sheet with all hole scores

Improve score sheet look

Slope ground (might be easier to thing about this like a speed boost in one direction that an actual ramp)

Different shaped course

Design on a grid, draw mode? Build timer

Win screen

Sound effects
