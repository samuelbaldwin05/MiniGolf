BUGS

Restart round button in free play should not exist, sends to build mode

Weird scoreboard in multiplayer



FUTURE FIXES (minor things that can be changed letter)

Ugly menu screen, and is different for when a game ends than when the app is first loaded

On build reset, everything resets except ball (all or nothing)

Expandable score sheet with all hole scores

Improve score sheet look

Slope ground (might be easier to thing about this like a speed boost in one direction that an actual ramp)

Different shaped course

Design on a grid, draw mode? Build timer

Win screen

Sound effects

More than 2 players on multiplayer

Choose your own number of holes in head to head

Have the outside walls act walls in that terrain can be put under it
